= Creating a nice Puppet Workflow

I'll jump straight in with some code examples:

=== Roles

roles/manifests/base.pp
```
# Base Puppet Role
class roles::base {
  include profiles::base
}
```

roles/manifests/web.pp
```
# Web Server Role
class roles::web inherits roles::base {

  Class['profiles::nginx'] -> Class['profiles::mod_security']

  include profiles::nginx
  include profiles::mod_security
  include profiles::deploy_agent
