Well, I'm now about to begin working for the 4th company in a year... Yes, 4 different jobs in 12 months! Many of the people I talk to about this often give words of caution such as: "It'll look bad on your CV." so I went looking for a role and a company that could give me what it would appear to be obvious that I need: the opportunity to work across a broad range of business domains, with a variety of technology and more importantly a variety of people and ideas.

I had already identified a company that would allow me to fulfil all of those needs but in the past had suffered the "I'm not good enough" or imposter syndrome which I'll talk about in another post. Researching the company on GlassDoor and Indeed served to make me even more cautious seeing them roll in at #2 or #3 in many of the "Top 10 Toughest Tech Interviews". I thought they'd be full of Jedi's riding Unicorns and take nothing less. 

I then recalled interviewing many, many people for a role in the Infrastructure Team at a previous employer, I remembered that I'd been offered a role that was branded impossible to fill by recruiters (VMWare, Ubuntu, CentOS, Puppet, SAN Management, Hands-On DC Experience, Asterisk PBX, Tomcat, Java, NGINX and Large-Scale Sharded MySQL Experience. Non Negotiable.) and I remembered that I'd done a hell of a lot at my current (ex)workplace taking it from zero to fully managed with Puppet (masterless), Service Monitoring with Nagios, Centralised Logging with the ELK Stack, Auth with FreeIPA and that was in my first 2 weeks. It suddenly occured to me that "I am good enough" and I applied to ThoughtWorks' Manchester office. 

The recruitment process is tough, but it's more daunting than technically difficult. I appreciated everything that was thrown at me, the technical assignment, the several interviews and logic and reasoning tests. It goes to show that they really care about hiring the right people witht he right abilities and the right attitude (not giving up or being afraid to be challenged on your decisions). My favourite part of the interview day was the lunch, not because I love food (which I do) but because I got to speak to so many different people in different roles and they were all very interesting and passionate people. The whole process took around 3 weeks from initial phone call through to being surprised with an official offer of employment.
